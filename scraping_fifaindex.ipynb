    "In this notebook, I try to illustrate the step-by-step of scraping football players information from the [FIFA Index website](https://www.fifaindex.com/). The only purpose of this notebook is to serve as a hands-on tutorial on how to do web scraping using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and to explain the code that is able to return the players dataset used in this project (the functions in the scraping_functions.py file). Despite the fact that there are many tutorials of web scraping on the internet (like [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-short-practical-how-to-guide-to-scrape-data-from-a-website-using-python-888373227d4f)), I think I learned a lot more here since the information that I was interested is spread in many different HTML tags, and the page layouts change depending on some player features (and also because there is no better tutorial than getting your hands dirty). **As always, any suggestion or constructive criticism is welcome**."

The only thing that I want to know is the name of the club and national team of the player (if any). Depending on the player, the number and order of the cards may change. For example, if a player does not play for his national team, this card will be missing in the page (See, for instance, [Dayot Upamecano](https://www.fifaindex.com/player/229558/dayot-upamecano/)). Free Agents like [Schetino](https://www.fifaindex.com/player/245309/egidio-maestre-schetino/) have the national team on the right card instead of on the left, and other players like [Walker Zimmerman](https://www.fifaindex.com/player/212591/walker-zimmerman/) do not have any information at all. Also, players that do not belong to a club cannot have a wage or value information. For this reason, it is useful to define the **team_info** variable below, which allows us to count the number of teams of the player and check who they are. In the get_player_data function this variable is important to avoid errors in the code that could be generated from missing information in some player webpages."

In the code below we make sure that we do not lose progress if we have a problem at some point of the scraping. Also, I try to [be a nice guy by not scraping the website too fast](https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-prevent-getting-blacklisted-while-scraping/) (I also make sure of this in the defined functions). By the end of the day (and with that I mean almost 24 hours of scraping) you will have the fifaindex dataset that I used in the project (or any other dataset from this website)."
